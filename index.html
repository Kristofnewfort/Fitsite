        "I love my sessions with Nat. We‚Äôve just reached 100 hours! Nat uses specificity for every one of her clients dependent on their goals. She keeps me motivated and never lets me cut any corners (no matter how hard I try). She has deep knowledge of nutrition, biomechanics, and functionality and sets training programs that keep me motivated and driven throughout the week."<br>

        "Working with Danny Webster as my PT helped me gain confidence in my form as well as confidence in myself overall. His approach is designed to inspire you to do more than you think is possible, all in a personalized way. Really can‚Äôt thank him enough."<br>

      <div class="testimonial">
        "After training with Natalie consistently for 9 months I've made some great progress physically. I've gone from not being able to do any pull ups unassisted to doing six, I'm squatting ~40% more, I've put on a few kilos of lean mass, and I've made huge strides in correcting muscle imbalances so that now I can perform lunges and other unilateral movements without knee pain for the first time in many years! On top of that, thanks to Natalie's in-depth knowledge of anatomy, nutrition, and exercise science she's taught me a TON about how to perform exercises safely for my specific body proportions and how to eat well to support my fitness goals. She's been able to answer all of my nerdy exercise/diet related questions throughout our time together (and believe me, there were a lot! üòÇ) Last but certainly not least, Natalie's helped to keep me motivated through some difficult times (physically and mentally) and thanks to her compassionate and pragmatic advice, aided me in building a more balanced and healthy attitude towards food, my body, and my goals. I would (and have) wholeheartedly recommend training with Natalie to anyone looking to improve their strength, health, or fitness!"<br>

        "Natalie is an incredible trainer. She pushes me to achieve goals I didn‚Äôt think I could and work on specific areas which I have struggled with. Workouts with her are always positive and challenging but rewarding and I never get the pre-workout dread. She is also very helpfully flexible with my schedule and compassionate. I was hesitant to start working with a trainer at first but I‚Äôm so glad I took the plunge. I would definitely recommend Natalie to anyone who was in my position before."<br>

        "Nat was an amazing choice when I was looking for a personal trainer. She understood what I was looking for and built a programme based around my work schedule. Her commitment to me meant I saw crazy changes to my body and physique. Her training also set me up for when I had to leave her due to moving back to London. Nat taught me so much and I haven‚Äôt found a better PT since!"<br>

        "I have had the pleasure of working with Natalie for almost two years now and I cannot express how grateful I am for the incredible fitness journey we have embarked on together. From the moment I walked into the gym (post-double mastectomy after breast cancer), it was evident that Natalie was not just a personal trainer, but a dedicated fitness professional with a passion for helping clients to achieve their goals. Natalie possesses an impressive depth of knowledge in fitness, nutrition, and overall wellness. What sets her apart is her ability to tailor a programme specifically to my needs and goals. Whether it was weight loss, strength training, or post-op recovery, Natalie has always had a carefully crafted plan in place to suit my needs. Natalie is not just a trainer, she is a supportive ally in my fitness journey who genuinely cares about my progress and well-being."<br>

        "It's been nearly 1 year working with Danny as my PT. He‚Äôs been invaluable for keeping me motivated with working out as he‚Äôs kept throwing challenging workouts that were stimulating for me whilst I‚Äôve been under a very intense schedule career wise."<br>
        <b>&mdash; Mattia Bradascio</b>

      <div class="testimonial">
        "I have been training with Danny at Third Space on the transformation program since 23rd September 2024. Originally I was attracted by the program having already trained at ROAR and new that I needed a disciplined approach to reaching my goals of losing weight/body fat and gaining muscle. My training at ROAR was good, but overly prescriptive. The trainers were more ‚Äòmechanically‚Äô motivated to get you through a session. I didn‚Äôt feel that my specific questions/curiosity about training techniques were being addressed. I had missed a fair number of sessions due for various circumstances, I did feel accountable but only just.
      
        From when I first met Danny, I was immediately encouraged because of his thorough understanding of the program and other training techniques. However, his enthusiasm and commitment to my health and fitness goals came shining through. I felt like I had a fully vested partner that was motivated in seeing my personal development. Danny‚Äôs utility of technology to connect my dietary monitoring, and my whoop, together with the ‚Äòin-body‚Äô metrics and my mental well-being to drive my focus on a session-to-session basis fuelled my commitment to staying true to the cause.
      
        It is the first time that I have been committed in such a way to health and fitness goals, and I have maintained my motivation to this current day over 4 months later (though not on the transform program ‚Äì but now on Danny‚Äôs tailor-made program for me).
      
        I can absolutely attest to the training method, motivation style and constant dialogue educating me on various topics from working on individual muscle groups, stretching/mobility exercises, nutritional advice. I feel more knowledgeable and focused on a total transformation of my lifestyle which has occurred over the last 4 months. I stopped drinking, started sleeping more, eating more conscientiously all with a view of improving my performance in the gym.
      
        The biggest factor in all of this, is Danny himself. He always checks in on my mood and knows it‚Äôs a contributing factor when I‚Äôm actually working out, but more importantly knows its what actually brings me into the gym on the days I don‚Äôt feel like training. In over 4 months of training I believe I have only missed one session due to ill health. The reason is I feel totally accountable to Danny and don‚Äôt want to ‚Äòlet the side down‚Äô!
      
        I can honestly say it changing my life. How I think about myself, my confidence and my general attitude has dramatically improved. I count Danny as a friend more than a trainer, and I always look forward to seeing him in the gym! Thank you Danny!!!!"<br>
